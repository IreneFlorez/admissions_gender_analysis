A look at Simpson's Paradox using admissions data. 


By only looking at gender and admission rates in this dataset, males appear to be favored in the admissions process. Males were admitted at a rate of 48.6%, while females were admitted at a rate of 28.8%%

When we look at gender and physics admission rates we see a different conclusion, females appear to be more favored in the admissions process. Female physics majors were admitted at a rate of 74.2%, while male physics majors were admitted at a rate of 51.6%. However, there are more male physics majors. 92.6% of males in this dataset have physics majors.

Looking at the chemistry data, we find that there are more female chemistry majors in this dataset. 87.9% of females have chemistry majors. However, chemistry has a lower admission rate, 21.7%, than physics at 54.3%.
